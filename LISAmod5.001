THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

A PERSONAL VIEW OF THE ZAMBIA LIBRARY SERVICE.

PERSONAL VIEW OF THE SERVICE, BASED ON OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING WORK UNDER THE
VOLUNTARY SERVICES OVERSEAS SCHEME. IN KASAMA, THE PROVINCIAL CENTRE OF THE
NORTHERN PROVINCE, 3 MAJOR PROBLEMS FACED LIBRARY SERVICES-POOR TRANSPORT; THE
LEGACY LEFT BY AN ACTING LIBRARIAN WHO HAD OPERATED HIS OWN KIND OF LIBRARY
SERVICE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY CONFUSED ; AND THE LACK OF PROVISION FOR THE
PRACTICAL TRAINING OF NEWLY QUALIFIED STAFF. IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO
THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF AUTHORITY, DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORT, TRAINING,
PROFESSIONAL STATUS AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.
