THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
ANALYSIS AND CODING OF GENERIC CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS.

PRESENTS A FORMAL LINGUISTIC APPROACH TO THE REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC
CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF USE OF THE ALWIN
LINE-FORMULA NOTATION (AN ALGORITHMIC VERSION OF THE WISWESSER LINE NOTATION).
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REPRESENTATION IS TO PERMIT SEARCHES FOR SPECIFIC
STRUCTURES AND FOR SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE GENERIC
EXPRESSION. THE RELEVANCE OF PATTERN ANALYSIS METHODS TO THIS PROBLEM IS
HIGHLIGHTED AND PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS ON ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT ARE PUT
FORWARD.

PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES
AND THE FORMAT OF THE NEW PATENT INDEX, DERIVED FROM THE INPADOC DATA AND
INTRODUCED IN JAN 81.

COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. I.
INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL STRATEGY.
     
THE STRATEGY OF AN APPROACH TO REPRESENTING AND SEARCHING THE GENERIC CHEMICAL
FORMULAS (MARKUSH FORMULAS) TYPICAL OF CHEMICAL PATENTS IS OUTLINED. THE
METHODS UNDER DEVELOPMENT INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING STAGES' (1) THE DESCRIPTION OF
GENERIC CHEMICAL EXPRESSIONS BY MEANS OF A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL; AN
APPROACH TO THE GENERATION AND RECOGNITION OF SUBSTITUENTS OR RADICALS DEFINED
BY GENERIC NOMENCLATURAL EXPRESSIONS, VIA FORMAL GRAMMARS; (3) METHODS FOR
AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF SCREEN CHARACTERISTICS, INDIVIDUALLY AND WITHIN THE
RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL FRAMEWORKS DEFINED BY GENERIC FORMULAS; (4) SEARCH
TECHNIQUES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC STRUCTURES AND SUBSTRUCTURES WITHIN
GENERIC FORMULAS BASED ON THESE METHODS.

GENSAL, A FORMAL LANGUAGE FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL, IS DESCRIBED WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR THE CONCISE AND
UNAMBIGUOUS REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC STRUCTURES FROM CHEMICAL PATENTS
('MARKUSH FORMULAS') IN A MANNER WHICH IS INTELLIGIBLE TO A CHEMIST, YET
SUFFICIENTLY FORMALISED FOR AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS BY A COMPUTER. GENSAL CONTAINS
A NUMBER OF FACILITIES FOR SHOWING THE ALTERNATIVES POSSIBLE IN A GENERIC
STRUCTURE AND ANY SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEIR VARIETY. EXPERIENCE TO
DATE SUGGESTS THAT GENSAL IS CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH MOST OF THE TYPES OF
GENERIC STATEMENT ENCOUNTERED IN PATENTS.

COMPUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 3.
CHEMICAL GRAMMARS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.
     
A SIMPLE TOPOLOGICAL CHEMICAL GRAMMAR IS DEVELOPED, AND ITS POSSIBLE
APPLICATIONS TO THE COMPUTER MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES ARE
DISCUSSED. THE GENERATIVE AND RECOGNITIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE GRAMMAR ARE
ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES. CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING THE ROLE OF SUCH
CAPABILITIES IN A GENERIC (MARKUSH) STRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM.
